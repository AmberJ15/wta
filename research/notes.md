## Analysis of the most common themes from competitive websites.

We analysed Barnes, Walthall and H&R
 + Navigation — the menu bars were located at the top for easy spotting and fast navigation. One didn’t have to look or scroll all over to find other pages.
 + Content Voice & Tone — Reading through the websites, there is an obvious business tone, based off the language and vocabulary used throughout the pages.
 + Design Aesthetic & Layout — All home pages had a large picture to give a visual on what their company is about. There was bold colors and block text used throughout all 3 sites.
